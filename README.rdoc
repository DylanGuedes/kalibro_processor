  You can find a script to install it on any machine with Rails on https://gist.github.com/rafamanzo/9859244. After running this script, run ```unset BUNDLE_GEMFILE```.
  By default Mezuro will expect it to be running on port 8081 at localhost.
  In order to run it as expected, run: ```rails s -p 8081```.

* Deployment instructions

  Deployment is made through Capistano (https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano)
