Kalibro Processor is a source code analysis web service. Part of the Mezuro project.

It was strongly based on the vintage Kalibro (https://github.com/mezuro/kalibro) written in Java mostly by Carlos Morais (carlos88morais at gmail dot com) on his MSc dissertation (in portuguese http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-25092013-142158/en.php)

=== Development


* System dependencies (Ubuntu package names)

  * build-essential

  * curl

  * postgresql-server-dev-9.1

* Ruby version

  2.1.2

  You can easily install it through the Ruby Version Manager - RVM. Instructions on how to do it can be found at http://rvm.io

  *NOTE:* If you are using the gnome-shell, or any derivate like terminator, you have to mark on your profile the option to use a "login bash".


* Configuration

    ./bin/setup

  This will create all the configuration files with defaults for Ubuntu and initialize your database.

  * Local environment

    ```RAILS_ENV=local ./bin/setup```

    This is a environment used when you want to use the server for acceptance tests from other services like Prezento. It uses a delayed_job queue for processings. So in order to process run:

    ```RAILS_ENV=local rake jobs:work```

* How to run the test suite

    rake

  *NOTE:* For this you will need the Kalibro Gatekeeper service up and running as explained below.

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

  * Kalibro Gatekeeper v0.2.0 (https://github.com/mezuro/kalibro_gatekeeper/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
    * You can find a script to install it on any machine with Rails on https://gist.github.com/rafamanzo/9859244. After running this script, run ```unset BUNDLE_GEMFILE```.
    * By default Kalibro Processor will expect it to be running on port 8081 at localhost.
    * In order to run it as expected, run: ```RAILS_ENV=local rails s -p 8081```.

* Deployment instructions

  Deployment is made through Capistano (https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano)

    cap production deploy

  In order to do this, you must have your ssh key set at the target server.

  Otherwise, you can also modify the deployment file at <tt>config/deploy.rb</tt>.

=== Install

* First Deploy

  1. Make sure that the deployment file <tt>config/deploy.rb</tt> is correctly configured to the installation server;
  2. Also, make sure that the installation server already has rvm installed;
  3. <tt>cap deploy:setup</tt> will install the ruby correct ruby version, the gemset and all the directories tree;
  4. <tt>cap deploy:migrations</tt> deploys the code and run all the migrations
